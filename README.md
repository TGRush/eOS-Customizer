# eOS-Customizer

## A script to do...elementaryOS stuff I guess

This allows you to do a bit of customization that is commonly done on elementaryOS in an automated manner, like for example installing Namarupa for Appindicator support, installing Pantheon/Elementary Tweaks, and installing icon packs to match the elementaryOS stylesheet.

### Currently included is:

- **Namarupa** - Appindicator support
- **Pantheon Tweaks** - Additional settings for the Pantheon desktop
- **elemenatyPlus** - A supplement to the official elementaryOS icons to support more applications
- **enable PPAs** - This just enables PPAs again (Also applies when installing Pantheon Tweaks)
